Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining good health and well-being, particularly for older adults, who may be more susceptible to various health issues. In this project, we propose to develop a non-invasive sleep state analysis system for elderly people using thermal imaging technology. By assessing sleep patterns and detecting potential sleep disturbances, our goal is to provide valuable insights to caregivers and healthcare professionals, enabling better management of elderly individuals' sleep health.
