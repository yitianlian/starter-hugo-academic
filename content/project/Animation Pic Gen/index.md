The rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), particularly Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), has paved the way for generating high-quality and visually coherent images. In this project, we aim to leverage the power of DCGANs to generate animated images, contributing to the fields of animation and digital art.

By training a DCGAN on a large dataset of animated images, we intend to develop a model that can generate novel and visually appealing animations. This project can potentially reduce the manual labor involved in creating animated content and inspire new creative possibilities in the animation industry.
