As older adults may experience weakened immune systems and reduced lung function, detecting coughs early on can be crucial for identifying underlying health issues and preventing complications. In this project, we aim to develop an AI-powered cough detection system designed specifically for elderly people. By leveraging machine learning and audio processing techniques, our goal is to create a reliable and non-invasive tool that can help caregivers and healthcare professionals monitor the health of older individuals.

By developing an AI-powered cough detection system for elderly people, this project aims to improve the quality of care and health monitoring for this vulnerable population. The resulting solution can assist in the early identification of potential health issues, enabling timely interventions and better management of elderly individuals' well-being.
