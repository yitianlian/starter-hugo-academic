I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at Xidian University, with visiting research experiences at HKU and KAUST. Currently, I am interning at Shanghai AI Lab, focusing on improving open-source LLMs for real-world tasks.

My research interests lie in **LLM reasoning** and **real-world task solving** using LLMs. I am particularly fascinated by how LLMs can be enhanced to perform complex reasoning and planning in practical applications. I believe there is great potential in refining LLMs to bridge the gap between language models and consistent decision-making, and I aim to explore this further in my future research.

For further information or collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out to me at xiechengxing34@gmail.com.
