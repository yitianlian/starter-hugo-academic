abstract: "Blind face restoration aims to recover high-quality face
images from unknown degraded low-quality images. Previous
works that are based on geometric or generative priors
have achieved impressive performance, but the task remains
challenging, particularly when it comes to restoring
severely degraded faces. To address this issue, we propose
a novel approach TFRGAN, that leverages textual information
to improve the restoration of extremely degraded face
images. Specifically, we propose to generate a better and
more accurate latent code for StyleGAN2 prior via fusing
the text and image information in the latent code space. Besides,
extracted textual features are used to modulate the decoding features to obtain more realistic and natural facial
images with more reasonable details. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
for restoring severely degraded face images."
