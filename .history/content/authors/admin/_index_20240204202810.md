I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Xidian University. I begin with a nine-month internship at Sensetime during my first year as a . In my sophomore year, I ventured into the realm of face restoration, culminating in the publication of related papers at CVPRW. Currently, I delved into the area of LLMs Agent. This interest led me to an enriching experience as a visiting student at KAUST from July.2023 to Jan.2024, where I further honed my skills and knowledge in LLMs. Looking ahead, I am committed to continuing my exploration of LLMs and plan to pursue a PhD. For further information or collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out to me at xiechengxing34@gmail.com.
